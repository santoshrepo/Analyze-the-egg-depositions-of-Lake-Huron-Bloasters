# Analyze-the-egg-depositions-of-Lake-Huron-Bloasters

## Abstract

The purpose of this assignment is to analyse of the egg depositions of age-3 Lake Huron Bloaters
(Coregonus hoyi) across the 1982-1996 period and then forecast the depositions for the upcoming five years
with the best model. Initially, Model is selected by analysing between various models such as trend
models, Arima models, and then choosing the best 􀃝t model based on the various predictions performed on
the later part of the assignment. The best model is chosen to forecast the egg depositions for the upcoming
five years.

## Introduction

Coregonus hoyi is a 􀃝sh kind found in the underwater slopes in lakes such as lake huran. It is also known as
bloater which is in the family Salmonidae. It is around 25.5 cms long and silver in color. In this assignment,
